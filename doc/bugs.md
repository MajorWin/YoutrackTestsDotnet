Bugs found
- Login
  - Having a blocklist for characters available in login instead of allowlist lead to
    - Creating users with identically looking logins shouldn't be allowed. For example `login` and `l–ægin` - 2nd one has Russian "o" and that would be considered different logins.
    - Inconsistent behavior: logins containing regular whitespaces are not allowed, but using unicode whitespaces is ok
    - Using invisible unicode symbols in login is ok, so `root<invisible symbol>` would be correct login
  - Strange error message `Removing null is prohibited` is being shown when trying to create users with names `root` and `guest`
- Password
  - There is no limit on password length
- Email/Jabber
  - There is no limit on both email and jabber length
- Total user count label in user table is not updated as you delete users
- Error popup contains unnecessary empty `<li></li>`
